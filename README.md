# raycast-2d-remake

## Update

### 1.

Use "GetAsyncKeyState" to handle keyboard input and solve the auto-repeat issue of keyboard input caused by using "kbhit".

But be careful, it can only be used in the Windows system.

### 2.

Add color support, and you can change the color by editing the worldMap[][] in main.cpp.

Specifically, "1" is red, "2" is green, "3" is blue, and "4" is white.

#### Use "g++ main.cpp -o main.exe" to compile
